                                and I felt lost in a sea of despair. Joining this community was a turning point. Reading the

                                to face my own struggles. The supportive environment and shared experiences on चित्त became
                                my lifeline, and today, I'm on a journey to recovery. Grateful doesn't begin to cover it."
